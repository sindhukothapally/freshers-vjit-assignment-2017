INTRODUCTION :
Restaurant Management Systems are the crucial technology components that enable a single outlet or enterprise to better serve its customers and aid employees with food and beverage transactions and controls.
This system is developed to provide service facility to restaurant and also to the customer. This restaurant management system can be used by employees in a restaurant to handle the clients, their orders and can help them easily find free tables or place orders. 

LITERATURE SURVEY :
Literature survey helps to provide solutions with an easy way. And it also provides some knowledge regarding the technology.
Introduction to Java :
Initially the language was called as "oak" but it was renamed as "java" in 1995. The primary motivation of this language was the need for a platform-independent language. Java is a programmer's language. Java is cohesive and consistent. Finally, Java is to Internet Programming where C was to System Programming.

Java Architecture :
Java architecture provides a portable, robust, high performing environment for development. Java provides portability by compiling the byte codes for the Java Virtual Machine, which is then interpreted on each platform by the run-time environment. Java is a dynamic system, able to load code when needed from a machine in the same room or across the planet.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS :
Requirement analysis is done in order to understand the problem of the software system is to solve. The problem could be automating an existing manual process, developing a new automated system, or a combination of two. For large systems that have many features, and that need to perform many different tasks, understanding the requirements of the system is a major task.

Functional Requirements :
-> A food menu which lists various sections having items inside each.
-> A price chart associated with every item on the menu.
-> The customers who visit the restaurent.
-> Hosts and hostesses who allot customers tables or queue them up if all tables are in use.
-> Bus boys who serve water, clean tables, lay out fresh cloth, etc.
-> Managers who take initial orders, receive complaints, prepare and hand out the bills, etc.
-> Servers who serve the food on the table.
-> Executive chef who receives orders and expedites food preparation.
-> Line cooks who prepare the food.
-> Order register where the customer orders are stored.
-> Cash register where bills are generated and payments are stored.
-> Feedback system where customer complaints and feedback comments are stored.
-> The general restaurant facilities such as tables, chairs, utensils, so on so forth.

Quality Requirements :
Reliability : The system is more reliable because of the qualities that are inherited from the chosen platform java. The code built by using java is more reliable.

Supportability : The system is designed to be the cross platform supportable.

TestCases : All the test cases that are applied on the application should be passed thus ensuring the efficiency of the applications.
